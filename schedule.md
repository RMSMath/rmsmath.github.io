Monday Homework Packet can be downloaded [here](/files/Homework%20Packet.pdf). The 10-question assignment for each Fundamentals session comes from this packet. For example, when the _Factorials_ stretch is being covered, you only need to complete the 10-question section under the _Factorials_ header in the packet. It is expected that all members will attempt to complete the assignment 
for the week. It will be covered completely in the session.

The Mathcounts Toolkit can be downloaded [here](/files/Mathcounts%20Toolkit.pdf).

_Cancelled_ sessions are in _italics_. If a session is cancelled via email, then that takes precedence over this schedule.

Sessions in (parentheses) are competitions. There won't be normal sessions on competition days. Only attend if you are [registered for that competition](/competitions).
